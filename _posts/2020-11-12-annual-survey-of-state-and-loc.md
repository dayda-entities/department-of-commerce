The Annual Survey of State and Local Government Finances provides statistics on revenue, expenditure, debt, and assets (cash and security holdings) for governments. There are statistics for the 50 states and the District of Columbia, as well as a national summary.  Statistics are also available by level of government -- state, local, and state plus local aggregates.
