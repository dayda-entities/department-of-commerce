A national survey conducted to obtain information about household food expenditures, food program participation, food sufficiency, ways for coping with food insecurity, and concerns about food security.  The universe for the survey are households eligible for the basic Current Population Survey (CPS).  This includes households that are 185 percent of poverty and lower that will be asked all supplement questions as well as households over 185 percent of poverty that will be asked only a few questions, unless their answers identify  them as "food insecure" and therefore eligible for the entire supplement. This is a proxy response supplement.  However, interviewers are asked to interview (if at all possible) the person who buys or prepares the food for the household.
