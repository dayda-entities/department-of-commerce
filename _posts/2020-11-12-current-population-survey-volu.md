A national survey conducted to obtain information about the number of individuals in the U.S. involved in unpaid volunteer activities, and to measure the frequency with which individuals volunteer.  The survey also identifies the types of organizations that facilitate volunteerism, and the types of activities in which volunteers participate.  The universe for the survey is household members that are age 15 or older.  It is a self-response survey that only takes proxy responses as a last resort.
