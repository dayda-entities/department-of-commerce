A national survey conducted to obtain data on contingent or temporary work that a person does without expecting continuing employment from a particular employer.  The universe for this survey is each household member age 15 and older who had a job and worked for pay during the reference work or household members age 15 and older who did not have a job during the reference week but looked for work in the last year and were available for work during the reference week.  It is a proxy response survey.
