The 2006-2010 ACS 5-Year American Indian and Alaska Native Tables (AIANT) use ACS data aggregated over a 5-year period to provide reliable estimates of detailed social, economic, and housing characteristics for many tribal population groups at multiple levels of geography. Detailed tables on topics such as educational attainment, fertility, nativity, citizenship, income, poverty, and homeownership are iterated for many tribal population groups. For the AIAN, detailed tables are presented for up to 950 population groups in selected geographies such as American Indian and Alaska Native areas where population thresholds were met.
